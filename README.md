A QuickLook Plugin for Autopano Pro Files
================================

Quick look **pano files** for Mac OS X 10.5 and newer. 

Installation
------------

Place the Plugin into `~/Library/QuickLook/` to install it for yourself only, or into `(Macintosh HD)/Library/QuickLook/` to install it for all users of your Mac. If the QuickLook-folder does not exist, simply create it manually.  
There are aliases to these directories in the disk image you have just downloaded, so you might be able to just drag the plugin onto one of the two aliases to install.
